#           
#           Use this file to define dynamic NAT (Masquerading) and to define Source NAT
#           (SNAT).
#           
#           Warning
#           
#           The entries in this file are order-sensitive. The first entry that matches a
#           particular connection will be the one that is used.
#           
#           Warning
#           
#           If you have more than one ISP link, adding entries to this file will not force
#           connections to go out through a particular link. You must use entries in
#           shorewall-route_rules(5) or PREROUTING entries in shorewall-tcrules(5) to do
#           that.
#           
#           The columns in the file are as follows.
#           
#           INTERFACE:DEST - {[+]interfacelist[:[digit]][:[dest-address[,dest-address]...[
#     exclusion]]|COMMENT}
#           
#     Outgoing interfacelist. This may be a comma-separated list of interface
#     names. This is usually your internet interface. If ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes in
#     shorewall.conf(5), you may add ":" and a digit to indicate that you want
#     the alias added with that name (e.g., eth0:0). This will allow the alias to
#     be displayed with ifconfig. That is the only use for the alias name; it may
#     not appear in any other place in your Shorewall configuration.
#           
#     Each interface must match an entry in shorewall-interfaces(5). Shorewall
#     allows loose matches to wildcard entries in shorewall-interfaces(5). For
#     example, ppp0 in this file will match a shorewall-interfaces(5) entry that
#     defines ppp+.
#           
#     Where more that one internet provider share a single interface, the
#     provider is specified by including the provider name or number in
#     parentheses:
#           
#             eth0(Avvanta)
#           
#     In that case, you will want to specify the interfaces's address for that
#     provider in the ADDRESS column.
#           
#     The interface may be qualified by adding the character ":" followed by a
#     comma-separated list of destination host or subnet addresses to indicate
#     that you only want to change the source IP address for packets being sent
#     to those particular destinations. Exclusion is allowed (see
#     shorewall-exclusion(5)).
#           
#     If you wish to inhibit the action of ADD_SNAT_ALIASES for this entry then
#     include the ":" but omit the digit:
#           
#             eth0(Avvanta):
#             eth2::192.0.2.32/27
#           
#     Normally Masq/SNAT rules are evaluated after those for one-to-one NAT
#     (defined in shorewall-nat(5)). If you want the rule to be applied before
#     one-to-one NAT rules, prefix the interface name with "+":
#           
#             +eth0
#             +eth0:192.0.2.32/27
#             +eth0:2
#           
#     This feature should only be required if you need to insert rules in this
#     file that preempt entries in shorewall-nat(5).
#           
#     Comments may be attached to Netfilter rules generated from entries in this
#     file through the use of COMMENT lines. These lines begin with the word
#     COMMENT; the remainder of the line is treated as a comment which is
#     attached to subsequent rules until another COMMENT line is found or until
#     the end of the file is reached. To stop adding comments to rules, use a
#     line with only the word COMMENT.
#           
#           SOURCE (Formerly called SUBNET) - {interface[:exclusion]|address[,address][
#     exclusion]}
#           
#     Set of hosts that you wish to masquerade. You can specify this as an
#     address (net or host) or as an interface (use of an interface is
#     deprecated). If you give the name of an interface, the interface must be up
#     before you start the firewall and the Shorewall rules compiler will warn
#     you of that fact. (Shorewall will use your main routing table to determine
#     the appropriate addresses to masquerade).
#           
#     In order to exclude a address of the specified SOURCE, you may append an
#     exclusion ("!" and a comma-separated list of IP addresses (host or net)
#     that you wish to exclude (see shorewall-exclusion(5))). Note that a colon
#     (":") must appear between an interface name and the exclusion;
#           
#     Example: eth1:!192.168.1.4,192.168.32.0/27
#           
#     In that example traffic from eth1 would be masqueraded unless it came from
#     192.168.1.4 or 196.168.32.0/27
#           
#           ADDRESS (Optional) - [-|NONAT|[address-or-address-range[,
#     address-or-address-range]...][:lowport-highport][:random][:persistent]|
#     detect|random]
#           
#     If you specify an address here, SNAT will be used and this will be the
#     source address. If ADD_SNAT_ALIASES is set to Yes or yes in shorewall.conf
#     (5) then Shorewall will automatically add this address to the INTERFACE
#     named in the first column.
#           
#     You may also specify a range of up to 256 IP addresses if you want the SNAT
#     address to be assigned from that range in a round-robin fashion by
#     connection. The range is specified by first.ip.in.range-last.ip.in.range.
#     You may follow the port range with :random in which case assignment of
#     ports from the list will be random. random may also be specified by itself
#     in this column in which case random local port assignments are made for the
#     outgoing connections.
#           
#     Example: 206.124.146.177-206.124.146.180
#           
#     You may follow the port range (or :random) with :persistent. This is only
#     useful when an address range is specified and causes a client to be given
#     the same source/destination IP pair. This feature replaces the SAME
#     modifier which was removed from Shorewall in version 4.4.0. Unlike random,
#     persistent may not be used by itself.
#           
#     You may also use the special value "detect" which causes Shorewall to
#     determine the IP addresses configured on the interface named in the
#     INTERFACES column and substitute them in this column.
#           
#     Finally, you may also specify a comma-separated list of ranges and/or
#     addresses in this column.
#           
#     This column may not contain DNS Names.
#           
#     Normally, Netfilter will attempt to retain the source port number. You may
#     cause netfilter to remap the source port by following an address or range
#     (if any) by ":" and a port range with the format lowport-highport. If this
#     is done, you must specify "tcp" or "udp" in the PROTO column.
#           
#     Examples:
#           
#             192.0.2.4:5000-6000
#             :4000-5000
#           
#     If you simply place NONAT in this column, no rewriting of the source IP
#     address or port number will be performed. This is useful if you want
#     particular traffic to be exempt from the entries that follow in the file.
#           
#     If you want to leave this column empty but you need to specify the next
#     column then place a hyphen ("-") here.
#           
#           PROTO (Optional) - {-|[!]protocol-name|[!]protocol-number}
#           
#     If you wish to restrict this entry to a particular protocol then enter the
#     protocol name (from protocols(5)) or number here.
#           
#           PORT(S) (Optional) - [[!]port-name-or-number[,port-name-or-number]...]
#           
#     If the PROTO column specifies TCP (6), UDP (17), DCCP (33), SCTP (132) or
#     UDPLITE (136) then you may list one or more port numbers (or names from
#     services(5)) or port ranges separated by commas.
#           
#     Port ranges are of the form lowport:highport.
#           
#           IPSEC (Optional) - [option[,option]...]
#           
#     If you specify a value other than "-" in this column, you must be running
#     kernel 2.6 and your kernel and iptables must include policy match support.
#           
#     Comma-separated list of options from the following. Only packets that will
#     be encrypted via an SA that matches these options will have their source
#     address changed.
#           
#     reqid=number
#           
#         where number is specified using setkey(8) using the 'unique:number
#         option for the SPD level.
#           
#     spi=<number>
#           
#         where number is the SPI of the SA used to encrypt/decrypt packets.
#           
#     proto=ah|esp|ipcomp
#           
#         IPSEC Encapsulation Protocol
#           
#     mss=number
#           
#         sets the MSS field in TCP packets
#           
#     mode=transport|tunnel
#           
#         IPSEC mode
#           
#     tunnel-src=address[/mask]
#           
#         only available with mode=tunnel
#           
#     tunnel-dst=address[/mask]
#           
#         only available with mode=tunnel
#           
#     strict
#           
#         Means that packets must match all rules.
#           
#     next
#           
#         Separates rules; can only be used with strict
#           
#     yes
#           
#         When used by itself, causes all traffic that will be encrypted/
#         encapsulated to match the rule.
#           
#           MARK - [!]value[/mask][:C]
#           
#     Defines a test on the existing packet or connection mark. The rule will
#     match only if the test returns true.
#           
#     If you don't want to define a test but need to specify anything in the
#     following columns, place a "-" in this field.
#           
#     !
#           
#         Inverts the test (not equal)
#           
#     value
#           
#         Value of the packet or connection mark.
#           
#     mask
#           
#         A mask to be applied to the mark before testing.
#           
#     :C
#           
#         Designates a connection mark. If omitted, the packet mark's value is
#         tested.
#           
#           USER/GROUP (Optional) - [!][user-name-or-number][:group-name-or-number][+
#     program-name]
#           
#     Only locally-generated connections will match if this column is non-empty.
#           
#     When this column is non-empty, the rule matches only if the program
#     generating the output is running under the effective user and/or group
#     specified (or is NOT running under that id if "!" is given).
#           
#     Examples:
#           
#     joe
#           
#         program must be run by joe
#           
#     :kids
#           
#         program must be run by a member of the 'kids' group
#           
#     !:kids
#           
#         program must not be run by a member of the 'kids' group
#           
#     +upnpd
#           
#         #program named upnpd
#           
#         Important
#           
#         The ability to specify a program name was removed from Netfilter in
#         kernel version 2.6.14.
#           
#           Examples
#           
#           Example 1:
#           
#     You have a simple masquerading setup where eth0 connects to a DSL or cable
#     modem and eth1 connects to your local network with subnet 192.168.0.0/24.
#           
#     Your entry in the file will be:
#           
#             #INTERFACE   SOURCE
#             eth0    192.168.0.0/24
#           
#           Example 2:
#           
#     You add a router to your local network to connect subnet 192.168.1.0/24
#     which you also want to masquerade. You then add a second entry for eth0 to
#     this file:
#           
#             #INTERFACE   SOURCE
#             eth0         192.168.1.0/24
#           
#           Example 3:
#           
#     You have an IPSEC tunnel through ipsec0 and you want to masquerade packets
#     coming from 192.168.1.0/24 but only if these packets are destined for hosts
#     in 10.1.1.0/24:
#           
#             #INTERFACE              SOURCE
#             ipsec0:10.1.1.0/24      196.168.1.0/24
#           
#           Example 4:
#           
#     You want all outgoing traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 through eth0 to use
#     source address 206.124.146.176 which is NOT the primary address of eth0.
#     You want 206.124.146.176 to be added to eth0 with name eth0:0.
#           
#             #INTERFACE              SOURCE          ADDRESS
#             eth0:0                  192.168.1.0/24  206.124.146.176
#           
#           Example 5:
#           
#     You want all outgoing SMTP traffic entering the firewall from 172.20.1.0/29
#     to be sent from eth0 with source IP address 206.124.146.177. You want all
#     other outgoing traffic from 172.20.1.0/29 to be sent from eth0 with source
#     IP address 206.124.146.176.
#           
#             #INTERFACE   SOURCE           ADDRESS         PROTO   PORT(S)
#             eth0         172.20.1.0/29    206.124.146.177 tcp     smtp
#             eth0         172.20.1.0/29    206.124.146.176
#           
#     Warning
#           
#     The order of the above two rules is significant!
